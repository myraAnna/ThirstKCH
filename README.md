# ðŸš§ Deployment in Progress! ðŸš€

We're actively working on getting our website live via GitHub Pages. As GitHub Pages exclusively supports static websites, we have provided a full-stack application that can be downloaded and deployed on your local machine.

Stay tuned for further updates! Your patience is highly appreciated as we finalize the deployment process. In the meantime, if you're seeking a full-stack experience, feel free to download and deploy the system locally to explore its functionalities.
