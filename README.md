# ðŸš§ Deployment in Progress! ðŸš€

We're actively working on getting our static website live via GitHub Pages. As GitHub Pages exclusively supports static websites, we're creating an option for a full-stack system that can be downloaded and deployed on your local machine.

Stay tuned for further updates! Your patience is highly appreciated as we finalize the deployment process. In the meantime, if you're seeking a full-stack experience, feel free to download and deploy the system locally to explore its functionalities.

Thank you for your understanding! We'll notify you as soon as the live deployment is ready.
